# Learn-Python-the-Hard-Way-3-Personal-Exercises
#-------------------------------------------------
# This is a log of my completion of exercises for the python course "Learn Python the Hard Way 3". 
# 
# This repository will not include any code of my own creation, outside of that which is potentially requested in the exercises. It is simply a collection of my progress for professional and personal development.
#
# Should you find this repository for the reasons above (or otherwise), thank you for stopping by and my best wishes to you!
#
# Warm regards,
